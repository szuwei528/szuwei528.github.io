## Map
I am from New Taipei City. After graduating from university, I worked as a broker at Yuanta Securities. A year later, I resigned to prepare for exams and was successfully admitted to National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, returning to student life.

## Food
I love spicy food, and my favorite is spicy hot pot. I can handle very high levels of spiciness.
